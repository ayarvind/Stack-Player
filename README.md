This is a powerful and feature-rich video player website built using React.js, Redux.js, and Firebase. The video player is designed to play local system videos and has the potential to expand its capabilities to play videos from both local and internet sources.

## Features

- **Local and Online Video Playback:** Currently, the video player supports playing local system videos, and in the future, it will be enhanced to play videos from various online sources as well.

- **Unique Feature: Notes for Video Durations:** One of the standout features of this video player is the ability to add notes for specific durations of videos. This allows users to mark important moments or add annotations for easy reference.

- **Intuitive Shortcut Controls:** The video player provides an array of shortcut controls to enhance the user experience. Currently implemented shortcuts include play/pause, full screen, and 10-second backward/forward seek. More shortcuts will be added in the future to streamline navigation and video control.

- **Support for Various Video Formats:** The video player is designed to handle any type of video format, ensuring compatibility and seamless playback for a wide range of media files.

- **Flexible Playback Options:** In the future, the video player aims to introduce additional playback options, such as preferred video quality and playback speed, similar to popular video platforms like YouTube.

- **Drag and Drop Multiple Files:** Users can effortlessly drag and drop multiple video files onto the player, allowing for convenient playback of a playlist or queue of videos, playing them sequentially.Additionally, shortcut buttons is  implemented to play the next and previous videos in the list.

- **Video Filtering and Search:** A future development plan for the video player includes the ability to filter and search through the list of videos, providing efficient video management and organization. 

## Bugs and Future Improvements

Currently, the video player may have some minor bugs that are being actively addressed. I am committed to continuously improving the player's performance and stability to provide the best user experience possible.
